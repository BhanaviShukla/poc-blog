# Keeping Your Feline Friends Safe This Holiday Season

The holidays are a magical time, but they can also pose hidden dangers for our curious cats. As pet parents, it's our job to create a festive yet safe environment for our feline family members. Here are some key tips to ensure your kitty stays merry and bright:

## Oh Christmas Tree, Oh Christmas Tree

That twinkling tree is irresistible to cats, but it's a potential hazard zone. Secure it firmly and opt for shatterproof ornaments on the lower branches. Skip the tinsel altogether - it's a choking hazard if ingested. Cover the tree water, which can contain harmful chemicals.

## Deck the Halls...Carefully

Many holiday plants are toxic to cats, including poinsettias, mistletoe, and lilies. Stick to pet-safe greenery or go artificial. Secure electrical cords and keep candles out of paw's reach.

## Not-So-Sweet Treats

Chocolate, candy canes, and foods containing xylitol are big no-nos for cats. Keep the holiday goodies for the humans and treat your kitty to cat-safe snacks instead.

## Calm in the Chaos

All the holiday hustle and bustle can stress out even the coolest cats. Create a quiet 'cat zone' where your pet can retreat when things get overwhelming. Stick to normal feeding and play routines as much as possible.

## Be Prepared

Keep your vet's number and the pet poison control hotline handy, just in case. With some mindful preparation, both you and your cat can have a safe, joyful holiday season!

Remember, the best gift you can give your feline friend is a safe, loving home. Happy Holidays!
